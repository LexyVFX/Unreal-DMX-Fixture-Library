# Unreal-DMX-Fixture-Library
## A library for physically accurate Blueprint DMX light fixtures for use in Unreal engine

This repo is intended to be populated with PBR assets & Blueprint implementations of DMX Lights for use with Unreal Engine. Lexy will share any lights she creates into this Repo, and it will also be open to community Pull Requests to hopefully establish a freely available library of fixtures for using Unreal like you would any other Lighting Viz tool for the purposes of lighting viz or Virtual Production of Live Events. Examples and submission guidelines for this should be coming in the near future.

Development on this repo is starting to ramp up a bit for which details can be found here: https://youtu.be/5K58ZfSYoEA
